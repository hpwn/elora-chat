What if we were fauns? Haha. Just curious man, you don't have to get mad. Just look at that- _gets put in a chokehold_

## Description üìù

elora-chat is a versatile chat application designed to unify the streaming experience across multiple platforms. It aims to simplify the chat and alert management for streamers like [Dayoman](https://www.twitch.tv/dayoman) who juggle various services and bots during their streams.

## Why? ü§î

On 1/22/24, [Dayoman](https://twitch.tv/dayoman) expressed the need for a streamlined solution to manage chats and alerts during his streams. He wished to move away from unreliable bots and desired a human touch to his alert systems. Our motivation is to enhance audience interaction and provide a seamless viewing experience across platforms, setting a new standard for multi-stream chats.

elora-chat aims to:

- Reduce the reliance on multiple bots and services.

- Offer a single, human-supported chat system for multiple streaming platforms.

- Enhance the chat experience, ensuring contributions are seen, heard, and appreciated.

- Drive audience engagement, encouraging viewers to participate actively on their preferred networks.

Inspired by pioneers like DougDoug, elora-chat aspires to revolutionize chat interaction while adhering to platform terms of service, ensuring a future-proof solution.

## Quick Start ‚û°Ô∏è

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/hpwn/EloraChat.git`

- Navigate to the project directory: `cd EloraChat`

- Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) are installed and configured.

- Create environment variables: `echo "TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=\nTWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=\nTWITCH_REDIRECT_URL=\nYOUTUBE_API_KEY=\nPORT=8080\nDEPLOYED_URL=https://localhost:8080/\nELORA_DB_MODE=ephemeral\nELORA_DB_PATH=\nELORA_DB_MAX_CONNS=16\nELORA_DB_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS=5000\nELORA_DB_PRAGMAS_EXTRA=mmap_size=268435456,cache_size=-100000,temp_store=MEMORY" > .env`

- Start the server: `docker compose up`

- Connect with your broswer to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)!

## SQLite storage (default) üóÑÔ∏è

The backend now persists chat history to SQLite by default. Ephemeral mode keeps everything in a temp file so you can run without any extra setup. To customize the database:

1. Adjust `ELORA_DB_MODE`, `ELORA_DB_PATH`, `ELORA_DB_MAX_CONNS`, `ELORA_DB_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS`, and `ELORA_DB_PRAGMAS_EXTRA` as needed. Leaving `ELORA_DB_PATH` blank in `ephemeral` mode automatically creates a temp database such as `/tmp/elora-chat-<pid>.db`.
2. Restart the backend after changing settings. In `persistent` mode set `ELORA_DB_PATH` to a writable location (for example `./data/elora-chat.db` or `/data/elora-chat.db` when using a Docker volume like `-v elora_sqlite_data:/data`).

SQLite is the only storage backend. All chat history and authentication sessions use the same database.

Write-ahead logging, foreign keys, and sensible busy timeouts are enabled automatically via connection pragmas during startup.

### HTTP: recent messages

Recent chat history can be fetched directly from the backend with `GET /api/messages`.

Query parameters:

- `limit` (optional, default 100, maximum 500)
- `since_ts` (optional, RFC3339 timestamp or Unix epoch milliseconds)

Examples:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/messages?limit=20"
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/messages?since_ts=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)&limit=50"
```

### Export & Purge

Admins (or curious humans) can export chat history and purge old rows without touching the database directly.

#### Export via UI

After opening the web app (default http://localhost:8080), open **Settings ‚Üí Show export panel** (gear icon near the input) to reveal the **Export chat** panel near the top of the page. Use it to:

- Choose the output **format** (NDJSON by default, CSV optional)
- Set a **limit** (defaults to 1,000 messages)
- Provide either **since_ts** or **before_ts** in Unix epoch milliseconds ‚Äî the fields are mutually exclusive
- Click **Open export** to download immediately, or **Copy curl** to grab a ready-to-run CLI command

#### Export via curl

Export messages (default format is NDJSON):

```bash
# Stream the latest 1,000 messages as NDJSON
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/messages/export?limit=1000" > messages.ndjson

# CSV export
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/messages/export?format=csv&limit=500" > messages.csv

# Time filters (Unix epoch millis); since_ts and before_ts are mutually exclusive
since=$(date -u +%s%3N)
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/messages/export?since_ts=$since&limit=200" > recent.ndjson
```

Purge old messages (timestamps are Unix epoch millis, rows strictly older than the cutoff are removed):

```bash
cutoff=$(date -u -d '30 days ago' +%s%3N)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/messages/purge \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"before_ts\":$cutoff}"
```

## Usage ‚å®Ô∏è

elora-chat is easy to use. Simply start the server and connect your streaming platforms. The chat will be unified and available in your dashboard for a seamless streaming experience.

### Fetch recent messages with pagination

```bash
# Fetch the newest messages (default limit = 50)
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/messages" | jq "."

# Request a smaller page size
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/messages?limit=25" | jq "."

# Walk backwards using the returned next_before_ts cursor
resp=$(curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/messages?limit=25")
next=$(echo "$resp" | jq -r ".next_before_ts // empty")
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/messages?limit=25&before_ts=$next" | jq "."
```
